I (he/him) am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Institute for Analytical Sociology](https://liu.se/en/organisation/liu/iei/ias) of [Linköping University](https://liu.se/en), in Sweden and an affiliated researcher at the [French National Institute for Demographic Studies (INED)](https://www.ined.fr/en/). I study the life-course dynamics of segregation and social inequalities. You can find my full CV [here](https://maellecoursonnais.github.io/files/cv.pdf).

I am the lucky recipient of a Vetenskaprådet (Swedish Research Council) [project grant](https://www.vr.se/english/applying-for-funding/decisions/2025-07-02-project-grant-for-research-into-segregation-and-exclusion.html). Together with Selcan Mutgan (PI), Maria Brandén and Martin Hällsten, we will study how exposure to different socioeconomic and ethnic groups in domains of life—neighborhoods, schools, and workplaces—shapes segregation and inequality over the life course and across generations. 

I defended my [PhD thesis](https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1940281&dswid=-3628), *Places of Influence: The Lasting Imprint of Where We Grow Up*, in March 2025. My dissertation focused on the dynamics and consequences of the places in which we grow up. Using large-scale longitudinal data from Sweden, I examined how childhood contextual characteristics influence outcomes in adulthood.
