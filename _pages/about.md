I am a first-year PhD student at the [Institute for Analytical Sociology](https://liu.se/en/organisation/liu/iei/ias) of [Linköping University](https://liu.se/en), under the supervision of [Adel Daoud](http://adeldaoud.se/) and [Maria Brandén](https://liu.se/en/employee/marbr31). 
A quantitative sociologist by training, I investigate spatial inequalities using machine learning algorithms and advanced statistical methods.
